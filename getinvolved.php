                    We're trying to decentralize the internet. Come join us.<br />
                    
                    The most valuable thing you likely have is your house, aparement,
                    whatever. Somewhere that you can stick a node. A node is just 
                    a peice of wireless equipment that can communicate with other nodes.
                    Generally, the higher up the better, so if we can stick a pole on your
                    roof, awesome. We have meetings frequently at
                    <a href="http://www.airlighttimespace.org/location/">ALTSpace</a>. To find out
                    when the next one is, come over to our <a href="https://chat.projectmeshnet.org/#seattlemeshnet">IRC channel (chat room)</a>
                    and ask (or check the topic). It's also a great place to ask
                    any other questions you may have. In additon to that we have
                    <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/seattlemeshnet">a low traffic mailing list</a>,
                    a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/seattlemeshnet">subreddit</a>,
                    and a <a href="https://twitter.com/seattlemeshnet">twitter</a>. All are great places
                    to get started. If you want to be more involved than just
                    hosting a node, come by and tell us what you're good at.
                    Doesn't have to be computery, we need all sorts of people.

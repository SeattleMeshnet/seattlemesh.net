                <p>
                    The Seattle Meshnet Project is an attempt to build the physical infrastructure to run cjdns, a decentralized, encrypted, low latency routing protocol. Building off of previous wireless projects, we intend to create a separate network that will be resistant towards attempts to censor or otherwise impede free & legal speech, while also being resistant to natural disasters and other events that might take down ISPs today.
